    <p>We're a pretty queer bunch. We have a bunch of little stickers like this up all over the shop to make cis people feel a little uncomfortable for once. We're one of the only queer bike spaces in the country's queerest city, so we do our best. A central piece of Scenic Routes' mission is to be a space for people who aren't really welcome in the rest of the male, race-focused, white bike world. We aim to be a refuge from that, and to present bicycles as tools for joy and liberation, not just beating your bros on <a href="computer.html">Strava</a>.</p>
