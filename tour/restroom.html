        <p>We're not really supposed to say we have a restroom because it's not (and can't be made) ADA accessible. We've decided that we're willing to deal with an unlikely fine instead of contributing to the problem of there being no restrooms in San Francisco. Please don't tell the department of building inspection.</p>
        <p>The art on the walls of sesame st characters smoking weed was done by a friend of the shop. This building used to be a preschool!</p>
